When I was learning the Arabic alphabet, I met with a problem. When a teacher asked in-order, I could answer. However, when he asked randomly, I did several mistakes. So, I needed someone, who asks letters randomly. Unfortunately, I could not find anyone. Then, I decided to make a small web application. Maybe, it helps someone.
